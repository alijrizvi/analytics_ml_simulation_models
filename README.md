# Advanced Data Analytics & Machine Learning: Sports Simulation Models

This freelance project, mainly exploratory in nature, focused on using mathematical modeling and machine learning techniques to simulate and predict match outcomes in the sports of football (soccer) and basketball.

## Tools Used & Methodology
In addition to the AI-Augmented Data Analytics and Machine Learning skills utilized, concepts covered and utilized include Gaussian Distribution, Poisson Distribution, Correlation Analysis, etc. Work, including visualizations, was performed mainly in Python with a Poisson model also implemented in Microsoft Excel.
Using a holistically meticulous and structured approach to obtaining, transforming, and then using data for insights and forecasts, cutting-edge Data Science methodology was applied.

## Visualization
Engaging and Sophisticated Visuals such as Heatmaps were also created to convey insights optimally, such as a Poisson distribution model depicting the chance of each particular score turning out between two chosen teams.
